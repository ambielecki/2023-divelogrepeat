        It's pretty simple, just add some data and calculate! <b>All times should be entered in minutes, and all depths in feet</b>.
        <ul>
          <li>Entering a value for Dive 1 Depth will give a max bottom time.</li>
          <li>Enter a value for Dive 1 Bottom Time and get your pressure group.</li>
          <li>Entering a Surface Interval will give you your post interval pressure group.</li>
          <li>Enter a Dive 2 Depth and get your max time at that depth (accounting for residual nitrogen).</li>
          <li>Finally, enter Dive 2 Bottom Time to get your pressure group after Dive 2.</li>
